# sbox – Frontend

**Note**: This project is just a proof of concept. It’s ugly code and will be rewritten almost completely. It’s for showcasing the transparent encryption capabilities of the backend. In the future, this project will be reuploaded with much higher code quality and an increased feature set.

The sbox frontend is written with [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/).
